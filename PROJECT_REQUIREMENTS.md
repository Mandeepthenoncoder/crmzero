# Project Requirements Document: Jewelry CRM

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical requirements for the Jewelry CRM, a web-based application designed to help jewelry businesses manage customer relationships, sales processes, and showroom operations. The system will support three distinct user roles: Salesperson, Manager, and Admin, each with tailored dashboards and functionalities.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide an efficient way for salespeople to manage customer information and appointments.
*   Enable managers to oversee sales teams, manage showroom operations, and track performance.
*   Offer admins a comprehensive overview of the entire business, including sales, customer lifecycle, and operational metrics.
*   Ensure data segregation and appropriate access levels based on user roles.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with React & TypeScript
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Linting:** ESLint

## 4. User Roles and Permissions

The system will feature three primary user roles, all accessing the application via a common login URL and then being redirected to their respective dashboards based on their role.

### 4.1. Salesperson
*   **Access:** Limited to their own customers and appointments.
*   **Primary Focus:** Customer interaction, data entry, appointment scheduling.

### 4.2. Manager
*   **Access:** Data related to all salespeople and customers within their assigned showroom.
*   **Primary Focus:** Sales team management, performance monitoring, showroom-level operations.

### 4.3. Admin
*   **Access:** Global access to all data across all showrooms and operations.
*   **Primary Focus:** Business-wide oversight, strategic decision-making, system administration.

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Supabase Auth:** Leverage Supabase for user authentication (email/password or magic links).
*   **Role Management:** User roles will be stored in the database (e.g., in a `profiles` table linked to Supabase `auth.users`).
*   **Route Protection:** Implement middleware or higher-order components to protect routes based on user roles.

### 5.2. Salesperson Features

#### 5.2.1. Dashboard

**Row Level Security (RLS) will be critical for Supabase tables to enforce data access rules.**

## 7. UI/UX Considerations (High Level)
*   **Role-Specific Dashboards:** Each role should land on a dashboard tailored to their most common tasks and information needs.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear and consistent navigation.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application should be usable on various screen sizes, primarily desktop/tablet for CRM operations.
*   **Data Tables:** Use well-structured tables for displaying lists of customers, appointments, etc., with sorting, filtering, and pagination.
*   **Forms:** Clear and user-friendly forms for data entry (e.g., adding new customers).

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Security:**
    *   Secure authentication and authorization.
    *   Data protection through Supabase RLS.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users (e.g., 200+ salespeople) and data. Supabase provides good scalability.
*   **Performance:** Fast load times and responsive UI, especially for data-heavy views. Utilize Next.js features like SSR/SSG where appropriate.
*   **Usability:** The system should be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users.

## 9. Future Considerations (Optional - Post MVP)
*   Direct integration with email/SMS for appointment reminders.
*   Advanced reporting and data visualization tools.
*   Inventory management (if jewelry pieces are tracked individually).
*   Integration with other business systems (e.g., accounting software).
*   Mobile application for salespeople.
*   Customer portal for viewing purchase history or upcoming appointments.

## 10. Questions for Clarification
*   For "Add New Customer" by Salesperson: A detailed list of questions/fields to be included in the form.
*   Specific metrics or KPIs for each dashboard.
*   Detailed workflow for appointment assignment by managers.
*   Clarification on edit permissions for Managers regarding customer data added by their salespeople.
*   Are there multiple, distinct showroom entities to manage, or is it one "showroom" concept for now? (The data model includes `showrooms` table for now).

This document will be updated as the project progresses and more details are clarified.
